*****************
** DAO Pattern **
*****************
Definition:
		Data Access Object


Usage: 	To abstract and encapsulate all 
		access to the data source. The DAO
		manages the connection with the data
		source to obtain and store data.
		
		The DAO hides the implementation 
		details	of the data source 
		(DB, LDAP, etc.), and allows the client
		or business components to interact
		with an interface rather than the 
		data source objects themselves.
